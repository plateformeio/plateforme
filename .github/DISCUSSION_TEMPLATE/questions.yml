        Thank you for contributing to Plateforme! 🚀

        Please follow these instructions carefully and provide complete information for each question. Your detailed responses will help us address your issue effectively.

        Time management presents a critical challenge in maintaining and improving Plateforme. A significant portion of our resources goes toward addressing questions and resolving issues on GitHub, which affects our ability to implement new features, fix bugs, and review pull requests promptly.

        When you submit questions in a structured format following these guidelines, we can assist you more efficiently. Moreover, the process of organizing and documenting your question may lead you to discover the solution independently, eliminating the need to wait for a response.
